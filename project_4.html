            <p><strong>Motivation:</strong></p>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges of the 21st century is climate change. And in order to mitigate the effects of climate change, we have to take considerable steps today. Current evidence shows that food waste is responsible for 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions. A large contributor of this percentage happens to be students. Students, from ages 18 - 24, incline towards wasting food in large amounts. Research conducted by the University of Illinois College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences shows that this behaviour can be a result of simply not being taught how to conserve food at a young age. Our solution brings this statistic in light and tries to contribute to a greener lifestyle by the reduction of food wastage.</p>
            <p>As of 2020, there are approximately 10,000 international students, making up more than 30% of our student population. Throughout their degree, they occupy apartments off-campus and even go through the trouble of managing their own food reserve in some campus residences (Solin Hall). Students have a tendency to buy food in bulk, which easily ends up in trash cans or even locked away in the cupboards, never to see the light again. Therefore, the wastage of multiple resources comes into play (both money and food).</p>
            <p><strong>Our solution:</strong></p>
            <p>In order to foster a community spirit, we decided to create an initiative that not only reduces the wastage of food, but also promotes sustainability among McGill students. In the following, we will be diving deep into this issue by introducing our app “McFood”, McGill’s platform for sharing extra food.</p>
            <p>This app allows dealing with foods of two specific groups; dry foods and fresh produce. Dry foods can be exchanged free of cost while fresh produce (produced by the Macdonald campus of McGill) can be purchased at a cheaper price than local supermarkets. The reasons for this division in food types can be thought to be twofold: 1) to ensure that exchanged foods are of topmost quality 2) to provide McGill students a platform to access healthier foods at cheaper prices.</p>
