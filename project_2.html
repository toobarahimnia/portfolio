            <p><strong>Motivation:</strong></p>
            <p>Agriculture is one of the most primitive and significant professions worldwide. However, in this sector, several food producers are struggling to manage threats to their crops against disease and pests damaging the crops globally before it is harvested and stored for human consumption</p>
            <p>Our team aims to help farms in Ontario and Quebec, monitor and protect their crops from unwanted pests, while also reducing the overuse of pesticides.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Our solution:</strong></p>
            <p>Our team (CropVision) is proud to present an object detection based product that can tackle the issue of local farmers. The way it is structured is that multiple drones are flown through a farm searching for given crops and record video. It is then broken down into frames and analysed for potential pests. This would then be presented to the user through a UI (User Interface), allowing them to identify and handle pest proactively.</p>
            <p>With our product, recorded video of a crop would be processed with the help of Microsoft Azure’s Custom Vision. This would identify pests present in the recorded crop.</p>
            <p>The target would then be tagged based on the type of pest presented. The information then is sent over to an interface where farmers can access and use in order to strategize their pesticide process as well as get recommendations on the best ways to control them.</p>
            <p>Our application will take a video, and sends it to our deep learning computer vision AI built in Microsoft Azure. The computer vision AI will process the video, and our application will then call the Azure Custom Vision API to fetch the processed data. At the end, using the data, we highlight the regions of interest and output a video.</p> <p>Our preliminary design is focused on detecting targets through a recorded video. However, in order to provide our users with the most effective service, we will be running our application through flying drones for larger scales and mobile apps in smaller ones where they can oversee the entire desired farmland in a timely routine set by our users.</p> 
            <p>Through a remote control, our users are informed on the type and intensity of the pests threatening their lands and can make decisions much faster than usual and prevent financial losses as the result.</p>
