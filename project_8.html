            <p> Fluid simulation contains computer graphics techniques for generating realistic fluid animations such as water and smoke. In this project, we attempt to simulate a basic smoke model following the grid-based method described by Jose Stam in the <a href="https://d2f99xq7vri1nk.cloudfront.net/legacy_app_files/pdf/ns.pdf" target="_blank">“Stable Fluids”</a> paper.</p>

            <p><Strong><font size="4rem"><a id="header3">Vector Field</a></font></strong></p>
            
            <p>The velocity vector field of fluid (v⃗) is defined such that for every position x = (x, y), there is an associated velocity at time t, U(x, t) = (u(x, t), v(x, t), w(x, t)).<p>

            <p>We can think of this as a (multivariable) vector-valued function, whose input is a point (x,y) in two-dimensional space, and the output is a two-dimensional vector.</p>
	
            <p>The key to fluid simulation is to take steps in time and, at each time step, correctly determine the current velocity field. We will later see this done by solving a set of equations that describes the evolution of the velocity field over time, under a variety of forces.</p>
            
            <p><Strong><font size="4rem"><a id="header4">Divergence</a></font></strong></p>
            
            <p>The divergence is an operator, which takes in the vector-valued function defining this vector field, and outputs a scalar-valued function measuring the change in density of the fluid at each point.</p>
            
            <p>figure</p>
            
            <p>Negative divergence means a fluid flowing along the vector field defined by v⃗ would tend to become more dense at the point (x0 ,y0). Positive divergence means the fluid flowing along vector field becomes more sparse at a certain point. And finally, zero-divergence indicates that even though a fluid flows freely, its density (the degree of compactness of a substance) stays constant. </p>

            <p>The Navier-stokes equation is derived from mass, momentum, and energy conservation because physics of fluid and heat transfer phenomena are governed by three fundamental principles, namely mass conservation (or continuity equation), momentum conservation (Newton’s second law), and energy conservation (first law of thermodynamics).</p>
            
            
            <p><Strong><font size="4rem"><a id="header6">Conservation of mass</a></font></strong></p>
            
            <p>Continuity equation: The mass in the control volume can neither be created nor destroyed.</p>
            
            <p>formula</p>
            
            <p><Strong><font size="4rem"><a id="header7">Conservation of Momentum</a></font></strong></p>
            
            <p>Newton’s second law: In a closed system (one that does not exchange any matter with its surroundings and is not acted on by external forces) the total momentum remains constant.</p>

            <p>formulas</p>
            
            <p>𝑓𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦 is the applied force on the whole mass of fluid. This represents the gravitational force applied on mass, so the force density (force applied per unit volume) equals the mass density times the acceleration due to gravity, g = 9.81 m/s^2: f=ρg.</p>

            <p>𝑓𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 is expressed through pressure and viscous forces. The pressure gradient results in a net force that is directed from high to low pressure and this force is called the "pressure gradient force". 𝜏𝑖𝑗 is stress tensor [N/m^3].</p>


            <p>* The energy equation has to be considered if any thermal interaction is available in the problem.</p>
            
            <p><Strong><font size="5rem"><a id="header8">Navier Stokes Equations</a></font></strong></p>
            
            <p> First thing first, we need to derive Navier-Stokes (momentum) equation for fluids with the following characteristics:</P>
            <p>
                <ul style="float: right; margin-right: 25%;">
                <li>Newtonian Fluid</li>
                <li>Incompressible (rate of change of mass over time is zero)</li>
                <li>Isothermal</li>
                </ul>
            </p> 
            <p>Given a 3 dimensional space, fluids are subject to forces from all directions. Here, however, we only consider the X-components of velocity of the fluid, for simplicity. Same results can be generated for Y and Z directions.</p>
            
            <p>Now, in order to find the acceleration of fluid in move, we use the famous formula F = ma:</p>
            
            <p>formula</p>
            <p>As discussed in <a href="project_8.html#header7">conservation of momentum</a> section, there are three forces to be considered (per volume basis):</p>
            <p>
                <ul style="float: right; margin-right: 50%;">
                <li>Gravity (external)</li>
                <li>Pressure difference (internal)</li>
                <li>Viscous (internal)</li>
                </ul>
            </p> 

            <p>The force exerted by gravity is self-explanatory. Now let's move to the internal forces due to Pressure and viscosity.</p>
            
            <p>Considering only the motion of the fluid in x-direction: The motion of the fluid element is influenced by the pressure forces acting on the front and back surface of the cubic volume element. These pressure forces basically represent normal stresses and are therefore denoted in the following by the Greek symbol σ instead of p. In addition to the pressure forces, viscosity-related forces also act perpendicular to the surfaces and contribute to normal stress.</p>
            
            <p><Strong><font size="3rem"><a id="header9">Pressure</a></font></strong></p>
            
            <p>Fluid pressure is a measurement of the force per unit area. Fluid pressure can be caused by gravity, acceleration, or forces in a closed container. Since a fluid has no definite shape, its pressure applies in all directions. The net force due to pressure in the x-direction is given by:</p>
            
            <p>formula and figure</p>
            
            <p>In a similar manner, net forces acting in y‐ and z‐directions can be calculated. The total net force vector, due to pressure then is:</p>
            
            <p>formula</p>
            
            <p>The term in the parentheses is the negative vector gradient of pressure and the term dx dy dz = dV, is the volume of the element. Therefore, one can write:</p>

            <p>formula</p>
            
            <p>Note: the pressure gradient is a surface force that acts on the sides of the element. When the fluid is at rest, pressure gradient must be balanced by gravity force. When at move, it is to be balanced by gravity, viscosity and other effects in the fluid.</p>
            
            
            <p><Strong><font size="3rem"><a id="header10">Viscosity</a></font></strong></p>
            
            <p>Viscous force is A measure of a fluid's resistance to flow. Viscous forces in a fluid are proportional to the rate at which the fluid velocity is changing in space; the proportionality constant is the viscosity.</p>
            
            <p>formula and figure</p>
            
            <p><font size="3rem">Viscous Stress Tensor:</font></p>
            
            <p>In three-dimensional flow, the velocity or velocity gradient changes in all three directions. Due to the viscosity, the resulting shear stress is no longer only due to the velocity gradient in a certain direction, but also to a velocity gradient perpendicular to it.</p>
            
            <p>This situation is similar to the deformation of a fluid element. Imagine shear forces that deform the fluid element. In this way, inclined surfaces are formed so that the shear forces acting on the surface now affect another spatial dimension. In fact, in fluids, the stresses acting in additional spatial directions are not due to an actual deformation (magnitude of shearing), but to the shear rate.</p>
            
            <p>This insight leads to the introduction of a so-called viscous stress tensor, which describes the stresses (normal and shear stresses) acting on a fluid element:</p>
           
            <p>The stress on a surface pointing in the −i direction is the negative of the stress on a surface in the +i direction, etc.</p>
            <p>figure</p>
            <p>Writing the reference stresses in terms of their components, we obtain:</p>

            <p>formula</p>

            <p>Therefore, the stress (n) acting at x, t on a surface with any arbitrary orientation  n can be expressed in terms of the nine reference stress components:</p>
            
            <p>formula</p>
            
            <p>For an isotropic incompressible Newtonian fluid with constant [dynamic] viscosity, the components of the viscous stress tensor τ can be determined from the viscosity η as follows:</p>
            
            <p>formula</p>
            
            <p>The rate of angular (or shear) strain in the fluid particle as seen by an observer sitting on it is:</p>
            
            <p>formula</p>
            
            <p>The individual entries of the viscous stress tensor can also be determined with the following formula:</p>
            
            <p>formula</p>
            
            <p>xx , yx and zx represent the x, y, and z components of the stress acting on the surface whose outward normal is oriented in the positive x-direction.</p>
            
            <p>Due to the viscosity η, shear forces or shear stresses in x-direction act on the lateral surfaces of the fluid element and on the top and bottom surfaces. In contrast to the normal stresses, which are directed perpendicular to the surface, the shear stresses act parallel to the surface.</p>

                <p>From Jos Stam's paper we find that N-S equations are perfect for fluid flow simulation. Given velocity and pressure at t=0, we need to use N-S to find their values at t > 0. N-S equations are supplemented with boundary conditions:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul style="float: right; margin-right: 65%;">
                    <li>Periodic</li>
                    <li>Fixed (used!)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p> 

                <p>Fixed boundary condition: fluid lies in some bounded domain D. Boundary conditions are given by a function uD defined on the boundary ∂D of the domain. Condition should be such that the normal component of the velocity field is zero at the boundary,aka, no matter should traverse wall:  u . n= 0 </p>
                
                
                <p>Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition Theorem says a vector field w on D (a region in space, in our case a plane) can be uniquely decomposed in the form:</p>
                
                <p>formula</p>
                <p>Where u has zero divergence and is parallel to D (boundary of the region); that is, u . n = 0 on D.  P is a scalar field. Any vector field is the sum of a mass conserving field and a gradient field. This result allows us to define an operator P which projects any vector field w onto its divergence free part u = Pu .
