            <p> Fluid simulation contains computer graphics techniques for generating realistic fluid animations such as water and smoke. In this project, we attempt to simulate a basic smoke model following the grid-based method described by Jose Stam in the <a href="https://d2f99xq7vri1nk.cloudfront.net/legacy_app_files/pdf/ns.pdf" target="_blank">“Stable Fluids”</a> paper.</p>

            <p><Strong><font size="4rem"><a id="header3">Vector Field</a></font></strong></p>
            
            <p>The velocity vector field of fluid (v⃗) is defined such that for every position x = (x, y), there is an associated velocity at time t: <br>U(x, t) = u(x, t), v(x, t), w(x, t).<p>

            <p>We can think of this as a (multivariable) vector-valued function, whose input is a point (x,y), and the output is a vector with the same dimension as input.</p>
	
            <p>The key to fluid simulation is to take steps in time and, at each time step, correctly determine the current velocity field. We will later see this done by solving a set of equations that describes the evolution of the velocity field over time, under a variety of forces.</p>
            
            <p><Strong><font size="4rem"><a id="header4">Divergence</a></font></strong></p>
            
            <p>The divergence is an operator, which takes in the vector-valued function defining this vector field, and outputs a scalar-valued function measuring the change in density of the fluid at each point.</p>
            
           
            <img src="img/formula_div1.png" alt="Snow" style="width:30%" class="center">
           
            
            <p>Divergence can become negative, positive or zero. Negative divergence means a fluid flowing along the vector field defined by v⃗ would tend to become more dense at the point (x0 ,y0). Positive divergence means the fluid flowing along vector field becomes more sparse at a certain point. And finally, zero-divergence indicates that even though a fluid flows freely, its density (the degree of compactness of a substance) stays constant. </p>

            <p>Physics of fluid is governed by two fundamental principles, namely mass conservation, and momentum conservation. We use these principles to derive the Navier-stokes equation, that is the heart of all equations needed for fluid simulation here.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            
            <p><Strong><font size="5rem"><a id="header8">Navier Stokes Equations</a></font></strong></p>
            
            <p> First thing first, we need to derive Navier-Stokes (momentum) equation for fluids based off of the following assumptions:</P>
            <p>
                <ul style="float: right; margin-right: 61%;">
                <li>Newtonian Fluid</li>
                <li>Incompressible</li>
                <li>Isothermal</li>
                </ul>
            </p> 
            
            <p>Given a 3 dimensional space, fluids are subject to forces from all 3 directions. Here, we only consider the X-components of velocity of the fluid. Similar approach can be applied to get the results for Y and Z directions.</p>
            
            <p>To find the acceleration of fluid in move, we use the famous formula <br>F = ma:</p>
            <img src="img/formula_NS1.png" alt="Snow" style="width:50%" class="center">

            
            <p>As discussed in the <a href="project_8.html#header7">conservation of momentum</a> section, there are 3 forces to be considered (per volume basis):</p>
            <p>
                <ul style="float: right; margin-right: 40%;">
                <li>Gravity (𝑓_𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦, external)</li>
                <li>Pressure difference (𝑓_𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒, internal)</li>
                <li>Viscous (𝑓_𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒, internal)</li>
                </ul>
            </p> 

            <p>The force exerted by gravity is self-explanatory. Now let's move to the internal forces due to Pressure and viscosity.</p>
            
            <p><Strong><font size="3rem"><a id="header9">Pressure Gradient</a></font></strong></p>
            
            <p>Fluid pressure is a measurement of the force per unit area. Fluid pressure can be caused by gravity, acceleration, or forces in a closed container. Since a fluid has no definite shape, its pressure applies in all directions. The net force due to pressure in the x-direction is given by:</p>
            
            <img src="img/pressure_fig.png" alt="Snow" style="width:50%" class="center">

            <p>As you can see from the above figure, the pressure forces are acting on the front and back surface of the cubic volume element (along the x-axis), because the forces due to pressure are always exerted perpendicular to any surface (and we are only considering the x-axis here).</p>
            
            <p>These pressure forces basically represent normal stresses and are therefore denoted by the Greek symbol σ instead of p. In addition to the pressure forces, we are going to see that viscosity-related forces can also act perpendicular to the surfaces and contribute to normal stress.</p>
                
            <p>In a similar manner, net forces acting in y‐ and z‐directions can be calculated. The total net force vector, due to pressure then is:</p>
            
            <img src="img/total_pressure_fig.png" alt="Snow" style="width:40%" class="center">
            
            <p>The term in the parentheses is the negative vector gradient of pressure and dx dy dz = dV, is the volume of the element. Therefore, one can write:</p>

            <img src="img/total_pressure2_fig.png" alt="Snow" style="width:20%" class="center">
            
            <p><font size="2rem">**Note: When the fluid is at rest, pressure gradient must be balanced by gravity force. When at move, it should be balanced by gravity, viscosity and other effects in the fluid.</font></p>
            
            
            <p><Strong><font size="3rem"><a id="header10">Viscosity</a></font></strong></p>
            
            <p>Viscous force is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow. In many fluids, the flow velocity is observed to vary linearly from zero at the bottom to u at the top. Moreover, the magnitude of the force, F, acting on the top plate is found to be proportional to the speed u and the area A of each plate, and inversely proportional to their separation height h:</p>
            
            <img src="img/viscous1.png" alt="Snow" style="width:50%" class="center">

            <img src="img/viscous2.png" alt="Snow" style="width:15%" class="center">

            
            <p>The proportionality factor is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, often simply referred to as the viscosity. It is denoted by the Greek letter mu (μ) with the unit of [N.s/m<sup>2</sup>].</p>
            
            <p>The aforementioned ratio u/h is called the rate of shear deformation or shear velocity, and is the derivative of the fluid speed in the direction perpendicular to the plates. If the velocity does not vary linearly with h, then the appropriate generalization is:</p>
            
            <img src="img/viscous3.png" alt="Snow" style="width:15%" class="center">
            
            <p> &tau; is the shear stress [N/m<sup>2</sup>]. <br>∂u/∂y is the local shear velocity [m/s/m]. 
            
            
            <p><br><font size="4rem">Viscous Stress Tensor:</font></p>
            
            
            <p>In three-dimensional flow, the velocity or velocity gradient changes in all three directions. Due to the viscosity, the resulting shear stress is no longer only due to the velocity gradient in a certain direction, but also to a velocity gradient perpendicular to it.</p>
            
            <p>This situation is similar to the deformation of a fluid element. Imagine shear forces that deform the fluid element. In this way, inclined surfaces are formed so that the shear forces acting on the surface now affect another spatial dimension. In fact, in fluids, the stresses acting in additional spatial directions are not due to an actual deformation (magnitude of shearing), but to the shear rate.</p>
            
            <p>This insight leads to the introduction of a so-called <em>viscous stress tensor</em>, which describes the stresses (normal and shear stresses) acting on a fluid element:</p>
           
            <p>The stress on a surface pointing in the −i direction is the negative of the stress on a surface in the +i direction, etc.</p>

            <img src="img/viscous4.png" alt="Snow" style="width:60%" class="center">

            <p>Writing the reference stresses in terms of their components, we obtain:</p>

            <p>For an isotropic incompressible Newtonian fluid with constant [dynamic] viscosity, the components of the viscous stress tensor τ can be determined from the viscosity η as follows:</p>

            <p>Due to the viscosity η, shear forces or shear stresses in x-direction act on the lateral surfaces of the fluid element and on the top and bottom surfaces.

                <p>From Jos Stam's paper we find that N-S equations are perfect for fluid flow simulation. Given velocity and pressure at t=0, we need to use N-S to find their values at t > 0. N-S equations are supplemented with boundary conditions:</p>

                <img src="img/HHT1.png" alt="Snow" style="width:20%" class="center">
                
                <p>Where u has zero divergence and is parallel to &#8706;D (boundary of the region); that is, <var class="vector">u<span>&#8407;</span></var> . n&#770; = 0 on &#8706;D. P is a scalar field.</p>
                
                <p>Any vector field is the sum of a mass conserving field and a gradient field. This result allows us to define an operator P which projects any vector field w onto its divergence free part u = Pu . Multiplying both sides of the equation above by “∇”:</p>
                
                <img src="img/HHT2.png" alt="Snow" style="width:40%" class="center">
                
                <p> But since &Delta; . u = 0, this simplifies to ∇<sup>2</sup>p = ∇ . w (poisson equation).</p>
                <p> A solution to this equation is used to compute the projection u:</p>
                
                <img src="img/HHT3.png" alt="Snow" style="width:20%" class="center">
                
                <p>Applying the same projection operator to the Navier-Stokes equations:</p>
                <img src="img/HHT4.png" alt="Snow" style="width:40%" class="center">

                <p>Because u is divergence-free, so is the derivative on the left-hand side, so P(&#8706;u / &#8706;t) = &#8706;u / &#8706;t.</p>

                <p> Where we use the fact that Pu = u and P∇p = 0.</p>
                
                <p><font size="2rem">**Note on P (pressure): We can shrink the size of our "container" down to an infinitely small point, and the pressure has a single value at that point. Which means pressure is a scalar quantity, not a vector quantity. It has a magnitude but no direction associated with it. Pressure acts in all directions at a point inside a gas.</p>
