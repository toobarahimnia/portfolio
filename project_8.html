            <p>  In a similar manner, net forces acting in y‐ and z‐directions can be calculated. The total net force vector, due to pressure, is:
dFpressure =-(∂p∂xi+∂p∂yj+∂p∂zk)dxdydz
The term in the parentheses is the negative vector gradient of pressure and the term dx dy dz =dV, is the volume of the element. Therefore, one can write:
fpressure=-∇p           (will use this later in the N-S equation)
Note: the pressure gradient is a surface force that acts on the sides of the element. That must be balanced by gravity force, or weight of the element, in the fluid at rest (bc of the resistance against some force nature), or gravity + viscosity + other effects in the fluid at move.
Do we have pressure on the other sides of D-E?  Yes, but we are Considering only the motion of the fluid in x-direction
In addition to gravity, fluid in motion will have surface forces due to viscous stresses. Viscous forces, however, for a fluid at rest are zero.
* When the fluid is static there are no shear forces.
Viscous force is A measure of a fluid's resistance to flow. Viscous forces in a fluid are proportional to the rate at which the fluid velocity is changing in space; the proportionality constant is the viscosity.</p>
        
            <p>To be added soon. Use PC for better user interface experience. In three-dimensional flow, the velocity or velocity gradient changes in all three directions. Due to the viscosity, the resulting shear stress is no longer only due to the velocity gradient in a certain direction, but also to a velocity gradient perpendicular to it.
This situation is similar to the deformation of a fluid element. Imagine shear forces that deform the fluid element. In this way, inclined surfaces are formed so that the shear forces acting on the surface now affect another spatial dimension. In fact, in fluids, the stresses acting in additional spatial directions are not due to an actual deformation (magnitude of shearing), but to the shear rate.
This insight leads to the introduction of a so-called viscous stress tensor, which describes the stresses (normal and shear stresses) acting on a fluid element:
The stress on a surface pointing in the −i direction is the negative of the stress on a surface in the +i direction, etc. 
 xx , yx and zx represent the x, y, and z components of the stress acting on the surface whose outward normal is oriented in the positive x-direction.

Due to the viscosity η, shear forces or shear stresses in x-direction act on the lateral surfaces of the fluid element and on the top and bottom surfaces. In contrast to the normal stresses, which are directed perpendicular to the surface, the shear stresses act parallel to the surface. 
From Jos Stam paper: 
N-S equations perfect for fluid flow sim. 
Velocity and pressure known at t=0. Use N-S to find their values at t > 0.
N-S equations are supplemented with boundary conditions: 
Periodic 
Fixed (used!)
Fixed boundary condition: fluid lies in some bounded domain D. boundary conditions given by a function uD defined on the boundary ∂D of the domain. 
Condition should be such that the normal component of the velocity field is zero at the boundary: no matter should traverse wall    u . n= 0 

Then it goes to finding v and p:
Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition Theorem
A vector field w on D (a region in space, in our case a plane) can be uniquely decomposed in the form:
